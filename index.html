                <hr/>
                <h2>Why am I interested in coding?</h2>
                <p>Since I was young I started programming on the orginal version of <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank">scratch.mit.edu</a> (currently on version 3), which is a block coding website designed to get kids into programming. I then took a break after a few years and picked up scratch again just after the version 2 release, it was around this time I started using windows command prompt to automate tasks and create small text games. Soon after I started programming in python and I've been programming since, having worked on discord bots, automation, and several small applications that didnt really get far. My github can be found <a href="https://github.com/IsaacWP121" target="_blank">here</a></p>

                    <hr/>
                    <p>In my spare time I do a fair bit of competitive gaming, playing under the name "L0m", formally top 100 in australia for the game <a href="https://www.brawlhalla.com/">Brawlhalla</a>, and currently top 8 in Oceania for Rushdown Revolt. Both platform fighters. Here are a couple clips from my rushdown revolt tournaments;</p>

                    <hr/>
                    <p>Another thing I like to do for fun is making and listening to music, I've been playing trombone since grade 5 and have been playing guitar since the begining of 2021, I've also had experience with trumpet, tuba and electric bass. In terms of listening to music I listen to mostly blues, jazz, soul and funk, but I often find myself listening to more pop songs which incorperate these genre's in. One of my favourite albums to listen to is Sinnohvation, which is a jazz cover of nearly every theme in Pokemon Platinum, which is one of my all time favourite games.</p>

                    <h2><i>Programming</i></h2>
                    <hr/>
                    <p>My final hobby and passion is programming, I've done a lot of programming in the past few years, entirely teaching myself everything I know, watching youtube, reading through other's code, and often just remaking a failed project to get a better idea of how I can improve. My most fluent language is python, but I can read a little bit of C#, and a lot of html/css, I have also programming a lot in batch in the past, which is kinda like windows' custom programming language.</p>
